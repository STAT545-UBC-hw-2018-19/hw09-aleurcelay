Hello\! :raising\_hand:

This is the repository of my Homework 9: Automating Data-analysis
Pipelines for the [STAT547](http://stat545.com) course. Instructions for
this assignment can be found
[here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw09/hw09.html)

For this assignment, I modified Jenny Brianâ€™s original [make
activity](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/make-activity) by adding new
files to the pipeline.

## New files

  - [letteres\_freq.R](./R/letters_freq.R) outputs a tsv file containing
    the frequencies of letters in the `words.txt` file.
  - [report\_letter\_freq.rmd](report_letter_freq.Rmd) which outputs the
    [report\_letter\_freq PDF](report_letter_freq.pdf).
  - [README.rmd](README.rmd) which generates the README.md file with the
    Frequency of letters plot: ![Frequency of
    letters](./images/letters_freq.png)

## Makefile

To review my makefile: :star2:[Makefile](Makefile)

I modified the Makefile to add the new files to the pipeline to generate
the new plot and report, the README, and subdirectories to store the
images (plots), the data outputs (csv files) and the source data
(words.txt file).
