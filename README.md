Hello\! :raising\_hand:

This is the repository of my Homework 9: Automating Data-analysis
Pipelines for the [STAT547](http://stat545.com) course. Instructions for
this assignment can be found
[here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw09/hw09.html)

For this assignment, I modified Jenny Brianâ€™s original [make
activity](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/make-activity) by adding new
files to the pipeline.

## Added files

## Frequency of letters

This analysis outputs a plot showing the absolute frequencies of letters
in `words.txt` The source code for this analysis can be reviewed
[here](letters_freq.R)
