```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load-dat, include = FALSE}
hist_dat <- read.delim("./output_data/histogram.tsv")
freq_dat <- read.delim("./output_data/letters_freq.tsv")
```

The file `/usr/share/dict/words` contains `r sum(hist_dat$Freq)` words.
I computed the absolute frequency of each letter, i.e. the number of times that a letter appears, and made a barplot of these frequencies.
