Hello! :raising_hand:

This is the repository of my Homework 9: Automating Data-analysis Pipelines for the [STAT547](http://stat545.com) course.
Instructions for this assignment can be found [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw09/hw09.html)

For this assignment, I modified Jenny Brian's original [make activity](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/make-activity) by adding new files to the pipeline. 

## Added files


## Frequency of letters
This analysis outputs a plot showing the absolute frequencies of letters in `words.txt`
The source code for this analysis can be reviewed [here](letters_freq.R)
